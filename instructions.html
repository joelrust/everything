Setup
</p></h3></div></header>

<body> <p>
Before beginning, place your phone on 'Do not disturb' mode, or turn off the volume for calls and notifications.</p><p>
Set the media volume so that the tones can be clearly heard, but with as little distortion as possible.</p><p>
If you end up out of sync (e.g. you lose signal and do not start with the rest of the group), do not panic! Turn off your volume and restart the program. Select your pitches from those you hear being sung around you.</p><p>
If you are having difficulty hearing the pitches, one earbud may be worn. If more than a third of a group wishes to use an earbud, all should.
